A Stripped-Down Replacement for runner.html

### Context
runner.html is a file that runs a GameMaker Studio 2 project that was compiled for GX.GAMES, and is compiled along with the project files when compiling a test run, but runner.html is bloated with unnecessary functionality, and that brings us to barerunner.html
### About
barerunner.html does everything that runner.html does, but strips away useless functionality and makes the website more simpler, these removals include:
- AD Removal
> There are left over ad functions in runner.html that to my knowledge are even used, so I removed it
- Useless Button Removal
> The Three Buttons on the bottom left are very useless (maybe not toggle console, but still), so I also removed then along with their associated code
- Simplized Background
> A Simplized Background that just matches the default game frame background (black)

And that's all

### Examples

### So...
I know that this is a somewhat useless repo to make, as no one will really use it, but idc, might as well
